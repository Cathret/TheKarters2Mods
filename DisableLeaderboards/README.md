# Disable Leaderboards v1.0.0

## Description
Can be used as Dependency to **disable the Leaderboard** and avoid sending bad ghosts to TK2 servers.

**Activate itself only if another mod requests that Leaderboards should be Disabled**. Keeping the file in the repository alone **won't disable them**.
